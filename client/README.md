## Description

As a user, I can search for different books based on the title of the book. I can create a personal account by signing up and then logging into the application. Once logged in I have the option to save any book that I search for to my personal page. When I go to my personal page I can see all of the books that I have saved and have the option to remove books from my saved list if I choose to.
